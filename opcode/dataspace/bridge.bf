The memory layout is to start in this form
 0x00   0x01   0x02   0x03   0x04   0x05   0x06   0x07   0x10   0x11
(0x1N) (0x2N) (0x1M) (0x2M) (0x00) (0x00) (0x00) (0xXX) (0x00) (0xYY) 
               ^
The goal is to store the values at 0x1N 0x2N at an index defined by M
We define 0x06 as index 0
[
  >
  bridge
  [
    >>>[>>]+[<<]<
  -]-
  >>>[>>]+[<<]<<
-]
bridge one more time to account for case when 0x02 is zero
>[ >>>[>>]+[<<]< -]
